**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**

Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is the most important metric a subscription business needs to calculate. MRR is a calculation of your normalised (amortized), monthly subscription revenue.

With a monthly subscription the MRR is simply the price paid each month for the subscription.
If customers are paying for more than one month up front (e.g. 12 months) you simply divide the amount paid for the subscription by the number of months in the subscription period.

> Note: You should exclude one-time payments and metered charges. Deduct any discounts prior to calculation and convert any foreign currency subscriptions into your primary currency.

**Example**

If you had 5 customers all paying $5 per month, your MRR would be $25. If you were to acquire two more customers on a more expensive plan of $30 per month, your MRR would increase to $85.
