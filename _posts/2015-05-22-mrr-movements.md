**New business MRR**

Only the MRR at the moment a lead converts into a paid customer (for the first time) is counted.

**Expansion MRR**

Any increase in the MRR of an existing customer, e.g. an increase in quantity, upgrade to a higher plan, adding a 2nd subscription, or a discount expiring.

**Contraction MRR**

Any decrease in MRR. e.g. a decrease in quantity, downgrade to a lower plan, or a discount being added.

**Churn MRR**

The MRR at the time a customer cancels (or fails to renew) their subscription (and they donâ€™t have any other active subscriptions).

**Reactivation MRR**

When a previously churned customer moves back onto a paid plan.
